# Parkinsons Disease Detection

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It is characterized by tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and postural instability. As the disease progresses, it can significantly impair the quality of life of those affected.

Early detection of Parkinson's Disease is crucial for effective management and treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods depend heavily on clinical assessments and patient history, which can sometimes lead to delays in diagnosis. Recently, using EEG signal-analysis techniques have been used to diagnose brain abnormalities. Data science have paved the way for innovative detection methods using machine learning and artificial intelligence.



In this notebook, we will discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to the "class" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.

Through this analysis, we will:

- Understand the key features associated with Parkinson's Disease.
- Implement machine learning algorithms to classify individuals based on their likelihood of having the disease.
- Evaluate the performance of different models to identify the most effective approaches for detection.

By leveraging data-driven techniques, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts in the early diagnosis and management of Parkinson's Disease.
